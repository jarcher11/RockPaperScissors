This project is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written in C#. The gist of
the game is to beat the CPU to 3 total wins by selecting the rock, paper, or
scissors options. You can play the game as many times as you want by selecting
"y" to continue or "n" if you choose to exit the program.

The 3 features I added to this project:
1. By using a while loop as my "master loop" where the user can repeatedly enter
 commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.

2. I Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important
events and writes them to a text file by using a streamwriter method.

3. I used a scoreboard like feature to have a visual representation of data--
mainly scores for each game one whether player, cpu, or draw.
